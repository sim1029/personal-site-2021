# Simon Says Hello

👋🏽 Hi, my name is Simon

🎓 I am pursuing a B.S and M.S. in computer science. I will finish my B.S. in 2023 and my M.S. in 2024.

🏙Pittsburgh native, with a passion for Software Engineering and teaching others.

💻 In the future I hope to work as a software engineer with a startup or a tech company with a diverse team and high pace work environment. 

🎲 In my free time, I like to play poker, go to the gym, and run. Lately, I have been cooking and plan to try my hand at woodworking.

💪🏽  I value communication and consistently work toward learning new skills. I am experienced with software development, I love TDD, and code optimization.
